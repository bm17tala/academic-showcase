# Academic Showcase Proposal

### Description
For our project, we will study a variation of the Vertex Extremes Search algorithm. We will be using various types of sorting algorithms with differing time complexities to demonstrate which algorithms are the most and least efficient. This will be used to not only find vertex extremes, but also sort the vertices in a range from southmost to northmost, and eastmost to westmost. We plan to visualize the vertices being sorted in this manner in real time using a graphical demonstration. We will use several sorting algorithms already studied in this course, such as Bubble Sort, MergeSort, Quicksort, and likely more.

### Timeline/Project milestones
* Week of 3/18-3/22 -  Complete file IO and other boilerplate so waypoints can be entered, and each point's coordinates are printed to the console for now until the sorting algorithms get implemented. 
* Week of 4/2-4/5 - Write implementations of Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
* Week of 4/8-4/12 - Complete tests, collect data, bug testing of algorithm implementation.
* Week of 4/15-4/19 - Begin work on graphical representation of algorithms, GUI's 
* Week of 4/22-4/25 - Finish/bugtest Graphical representations, possibly complete a presentation to display alongside running program.
