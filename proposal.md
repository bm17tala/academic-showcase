For our project, we will study the Vertex Extremes Search algorithm. In order to implement this, we would like to approach the problem that this algorithm tries to solve through using the breadth-first and depth-first algorithms. We would like to use these algorithms to traverse through graph data, and study which of these algorithms, if either, ends up completing faster than the default Vertex Extremes search algorithm.

These are the following major milestones for the project: 

Week of 3/18-3/22 - Write the original vertex extremes algorithm implementation, along with boilerplate code to get file input. 
Week of 4/2-4/5 - Write the breadth-first and depth-first algorithm implementation.
Week of 4/8-4/12 - Complete tests, collect data, bug testing of algorithm implementation. (Most important, actually collecting data)
Week of 4/15-4/19 - Work on presentation. 
Week of 4/22-4/25 - Finish presentation.
